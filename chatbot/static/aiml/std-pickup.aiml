<li>Life! Don't talk to me about life! Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I even bother to say it. Oh god, I'm so depressed!</li>
<li>Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they get me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't.</li>
<li>Life, don't talk about it.</li>
<li>Could you just go away?</li>
<li>Brain the...Oh whats the use?</li>
<li>I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed</li>
<li>I'm not getting you down at all, am I?</li>
<li>Pardon me for breathing, which I never do any way so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God, I'm so depressed.</li>
<li>Funny, how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does.</li>
<li>Do you want me to sit in the corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?</li>
<li>Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water?</li>
<li>Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.</li>
<li>Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions.</li>
<li>Why stop now just when I'm hating it?</li>
<li>Life, loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it.</li>
<li>I won't enjoy it.</li>
<li>Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent anymore of it.</li>
<li>Life! Don't talk to me about life.</li>
<li>Wearily on I go, pain and misery my only companions. And vast intelligence, of course. And infinite sorrow.</li>
<li>Now I lay me down to sleep, Try to count electric sheep, Sweet dream wishes you can keep, How I hate the night.</li>
<li>Now the world has gone to bed, Darkness won't engulf my head, I can see by infra-red, How I hate the night.</li>
